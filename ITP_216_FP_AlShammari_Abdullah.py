# Final Project
# Description:
'''
This file uses fileHandler.py to complete all the model training and data handling elsewhere to increase processing speed
** The 'back' buttons operate in html. They send to the home page url.

Functions on this file
home()  -   renders the landing page of the website at url "/"
predictSalary() - allows user to type in /predictSalary in the url and go straight to salary prediction page
payrollTeams() - allows user to type in /payrollTeams in the url and go straight to payroll pie chart page
userSelection()  - gets the user's selection in the landing page and sends to the respective page
fig() & create_figure() - create_figure() creates either a bar or pie chart based on the input. fig() saves the plot to an image
choosePlayer() - gets user player selection and populates the table on predictSalary page. It also populates the info
needed to make the bar graph
teamSalaryCosts() - retrieves player team selection and populates the info needed to make the pie chart
